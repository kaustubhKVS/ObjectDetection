# Object Detection

This repository serves as a plug and play template for training and inferencing in object detection tasks <br>
We chose this architecture of Yolov2 (you look only once) due to its added benifits over RCNNs in speed and accuracy<br>
RCNNs have a seperate region proposal network RPN while yolo doesnt and hence is faster and accurate
